This is my public portfolio for the Telling Stories with Data class at CMU! 

# About me
My name is Ana Garcia-Maunez, my pronouns are she/her, and I'm a second year Master of Arts Management student. Originally from Orlando, FL, I have a BA in Music from the University of Central Florida. Currently, I'm a development intern with Assemble here in Pittsburgh. I plan to go into development or potentially consulting after graduation, so everything I'm learning in this course will be priceless for any of my future jobs. 


# What I hope to learn 
I hope to learn how to use a variety of different dataviz resources and how to get an idea across through data visualizations. In the past, I've relied on using Excel charts and graphs without putting too much thought into it, but I would like to be more thoughtful in that process to make effective and well-designed data visualizations as I believe it will be extremely useful in my field.

Here's where all of my cool data visualizations will go!
