## Methods of visualization explained
The first data visualization is a simple bar chart. It is the easiest to compare and contrast visually per country as well as the chart people would be most familar with out of the three. The second dataviz allows the audience to get a clear picture of each country's debt-to-GDP ratio on its own, but makes it difficult to compare each country quickly or effectively. I chose to use a dot plot for the third dataviz because it allows the reader to view government debt by region and how it has changed throughout the years, essentially providing a snapshot view for each year in a 23 year period. This allows for more granular comparison than the bar chart while still being easy on the eyes. The chart is not too crowded, yet one can hover over each dot to get more information as needed.
