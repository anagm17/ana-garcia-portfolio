# [Fast Fashion: Cheap to Purchase, But at What Cost?](https://carnegiemellon.shorthandstories.com/fast-fashion/index.html)

## Part II: Wireframe/Storyboard & User Research 
For this section of the project, I built my wireframe and storyboard directly into [Shorthand](https://preview.shorthand.com/Mw6V94oX9wa2qxFI). I used a combination of Flourish, Infogram, and Balsamiq (for placeholders).

### User Research Method
I used the following [Google Form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSerrMtXQyCIarJnWUZgv0L4exwRLqsSSR3rcLoKAEEnbPqL-Q/viewform?usp=sf_link) to collect user responses from 3 individuals. Participants were selected to be a mix of those who possess varying levels of knowledge with fast fashion. 

My target audience is consumers, both those that knowingly purchase/enjoy fast fashion and those that may not realize they are shopping fast fashion. Hopefully the presentation will persuade consumers to stop supporting fast fashion brands and equip them with the better, more sustainable alternatives.

#### Goals for user research:
- Whether the overall message and story is clear 
- Whether the call to action is compelling
- What works, what doesn't, and if there's any more information/data I can include to bolster the story

### Questions/Responses

Detailed questions and responses can be found [here](https://anagm17.github.io/ana-garcia-portfolio/googleform.html).

#### Findings
Overall, the user research illuminated more areas where I can strengthen the story whether it be by providing more in-depth information or including additional data. I believe in adding this it will also help clarify who the target audience is. Otherwise, the visualizations I have now are strong with the exception of the first chart and its missing key.
