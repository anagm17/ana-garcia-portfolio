## Part III: Final Data Story

#### Summary 
In Part III, I spent a lot of time adding extra content that would help tell the overall story, as well as making design changes based on recommendations and feedback from Part II. I added more text to flesh out the story and also add context to some of the bar charts, such as the first one which shows the top 10 fashion brands. I edited my infographic to switch the order of data points and also swapped in one relating to greenhouse gas emissions I felt would be more relevant. 

In terms of design changes, I bolded the important data points in my infographic, changed some overall formatting of the story to flow easier, and changed the layout of my clothing cycle. To supplement the information in the clothing cycle, I added an additional bar chart that addresses what happens to clothing after production/use, which some people asked about in my user interviews. I also decided to change the timeline to move from top down instead of being a static image to take advantage of the scrolling animation feature.

#### The Audience
The audience for this presentation is consumers, both those that knowingly purchase/enjoy fast fashion and those that may not realize they are shopping fast fashion. Per user feedback, I fleshed out the call to action a lot more to include different price points for the alternative suggestions and various free options for consumers to make a change. I also provded clear examples of some top fast-fashion brands as well as how to spot them so consumers can keep a look out. In terms of design, I changed the pink color that was originally used for my charts so that it didn't feel like the story was only directed towards women, as one user pointed out in one of my interviews. 

#### What I learned
This project took a lot of time to complete, but it was a very useful exercise in using data in order to inform and persuade an audience to take action. This is a topic I am very interested and passionate about, and the final product is something I will be proud to share to future colleagues and employers.
