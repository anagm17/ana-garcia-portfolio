    <td>In your own words, what do you think this story is about?</td>
    <td>Environmental impact of the fast fashion industry</td>
    <td>The presentation is about how the rise of fast fashion is having a negative effect on our climate, despite the industry seeming benign in the context of the encroaching irreversible impacts of climate change.</td>
    <td>About the detrimental impact fast fashion has on the environment and what we can do to break that cycle</td>
    <td>The purpose of the story is clear.</td>

    <td>Who do you think is the intended audience?</td>
    <td>General public / people who like shopping and have shopped at fast fashion stores.</td>
    <td>The tone and content is geared towards those in the fast fashion industry and the patrons of fast fashion.</td>
    <td>Women</td>
    <td>The responses for intended audience were particularly varied. I will try to make it more clear who the audience is by addressing those consumers at the beginning.</td>

   <tr>           
    <td>Is the overall flow of information logical and clear? Why or why not?</td>
    <td>Yes, I think so! I was surprised when I got to the call to action. Adding something about the environmental impact of landfills could help with that.</td>
    <td>The information is clear and follows a logical flow of context, facts, impacts, and how to help. It serves as a nice call-to-action.</td>
    <td>Good use of visuals and graphics</td>
    <td>My information flow was clear and effective.</td>

   <tr>              
    <td>Are the data visualizations supporting the claims easy to understand? Why or why not?</td>
    <td>Colors weren't clear to me on the first chart, but I could just be dumb. I like the infographic-style visualizations a lot.</td>
    <td>The graphs added a well needed shock factor which underlined the importance of the topic. The only complaint I have is with the somewhat blurry visual of the history of the clothing industry.</td>
    <td>Yes, by well sourced data.</td>
    <td>I need to make sure the final data visualizations are high res. I may also re-do the first chart in another medium to be able to add the key (I used Flourish and had to override the color of every bar).</td>

   <tr>         
    <td>What questions, if any, come up as you read through?</td>
    <td>Are some specific brands worse than others?</td>
    <td>Maybe how these sustainable fashion brands are doing things differently in comparison to fast fashion.</td>
    <td>How am I contributing to this problem?</td>
    <td>I will include a blurb about each sustainable brand with more details. In the conflict section, I will name-call the big-name fast fashion brands and see if I can find data to support a ranking of which ones cause more harm, or at least some more specifics. I will also look for more data about how consumers specifically are contributing to the problem. This may also help in making the target audience more clear. I may also include more advocacy/free options for people to take action as well.</td>

    <tr>   
    <td>Did the story make you feel compelled to take action? Why or why not?</td>
    <td>Yes</td>
    <td>It did, the data visuals and content acknowledged the problem and highlighted the importance of taking action against said issue.</td>
    <td>Yes, to avoid buying fast fashion trends and retailers.</td>
    <td>My call to action was compelling.</td>
  </tr>
    <tr>     
    <td>Any additional comments or thoughts?</td>
    <td>It would be cool to visualize that the average fast-fashion shirt lasts less than 10 wearings, like if you could animate a shirt falling apart. I also wonder if you could add more accessible shopping options at the end. I know Patagonia and Everlane are on the higher end of price ranges.</td>
    <td>Very good so far.</td>
    <td>n/a</td>
    <td>I will order the sustainable options by price range and try to find more affordable options as well. The animation idea was cool too, I will have to see how I can make that idea come to life.</td>
