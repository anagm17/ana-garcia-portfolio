# Fast Fashion: Cheap to Purchase, But at What Cost?
My goal for this project is to convince my audience (consumers) the damage fast fashion does to the environment and show them more sustainable alternatives for clothing shopping.

### Outline
#### Set-up
Personal story: Have you ever bought a shirt or pair of jeans that fell apart after the first wash? It was most likely a fast-fashion garment. 
- What is fast fashion? Definition.
- But first: a (very) brief history of clothing industry—catalogues, standardization of sizes, rise of fast fashion, 12-16 fashion cycles a year instead of 2 (include timeline)
- How big is the fashion industry?

#### Conflict: Industry impact to environment
- Average number of time a garment is worn has dropped 38% from 15 years ago (Ellen MacArthur Foundation)
- Clothing lifecycle

- How long does the average fast-fashion t-shirt last? < 10 wearings (NYTimes)
- Clothes making is very resource intensive
- Fashion industry is 2nd highest user of water worldwide and produces 20% of global water waste (UNECE)
- It takes 2,700 liters (713 gallons) to make one cotton shirt (WRI)
- With all that being said, clothing production is rapidly on the rise

#### Resolution: Not all hope is lost
- Climate policy initiatives: ex) Green New Deal, UK Climate Plan 
- What can consumers do? Donate, repurpose clothes

#### Call to action 
To stop supporting fast-fashion and instead switch to sustainable alternatives (examples: Thrifting, Everlane, Frank + Oak, Patagonia, For Days, etc.)
 

### Data
For this topic, many of the useful datasets exist behind a paywall. Thus, I have compiled a list of sources and reports I will be using to either re-design some charts or pull data from in order to create this presentation. Here are some of the main sources:

### Method and Medium
I will be completing the project through the use of Shorthand and Flourish. I may also complete a seperate Shorthand page for the final presentation that just has my main talking points for the two minute presentation.
