# Final Project

### Fast Fashion: Cheap to Purchase, But at What Cost?
My goal for this project is to convince my audience the damage fast fashion does to the environment and show them more sustainable alternatives for clothing shopping.

#### Outline
Personal story: Have you ever bought a shirt or pair of jeans that fell apart after the first wash? It was most likely a fast-fashion garment. 
- What is fast fashion? Definition.

##### Story arc: 
Setup, conflict, resolution

##### Call to action: 
To stop supporting fast-fasion and instead switch to sustainable alternatives (listed with links in presentation)
Examples: Thrifting, Everlane, Frank + Oak, Patagonia, For Days, etc.


#### Data
A couple paragraphs on how data will be used and link sources

#### Method and Medium
I will be completing the project through the use of Shorthand and Flourish. I may also complete a seperate Shorthand page for the final presentation that just has my main talking points for the two minute presentation.
