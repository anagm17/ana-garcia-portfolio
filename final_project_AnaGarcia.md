# Fast Fashion: Cheap to Purchase, But at What Cost?
My goal for this project is to convince my audience (American consumers) the damage fast fashion does to the environment and show them more sustainable alternatives for clothing shopping.

### Outline
#### Set-up
Personal story: Have you ever bought a shirt or pair of jeans that fell apart after the first wash? It was most likely a fast-fashion garment. 
- What is fast fashion? Definition.
- But first: a (very) brief history of clothing industry—catalogues, standardization of sizes, rise of fast fashion, 12-16 fashion cycles a year instead of 2 (include timeline)

Fashion is a a $1.3 trillion industry (Ellen MacArthur Foundation)

- Average number of time a garment is worn has dropped 38% from 15 years ago (Ellen MacArthur Foundation)
- How long does the average fast-fashion t-shirt last? < 10 wearings (NYTimes)


Clothes making is very resource intensive
- Fashion industry is 2nd highest user of water worldwide and produces 20% of global water waste (UNECE)
- It takes 2,700 liters (713 gallons) to make one cotton shirt (WRI)
- With all that being said, clothing production is rapidly on the rise

#### Resolution: Not all hope is lost + Call to action
- Climate policy initiatives: ex) Green New Deal, UK Climate Plan 
- What can consumers do? Donate, repurpose clothes, and stop supporting fast-fashion and instead switch to sustainable alternatives (examples: Thrifting, Everlane, Frank + Oak, Patagonia, For Days, etc.)
 

### Data
This is a topic that has interested me for some time and that I have done passive research on for several years, whether that was watching videos or reading articles. [This report](https://www.ellenmacarthurfoundation.org/assets/downloads/publications/A-New-Textiles-Economy_Full-Report_Updated_1-12-17.pdf) written by the Ellen MacArthur Foundation informed the bulk of my project as well as helped me find addition resources and data to incorporate. McKinsey & Company, the World Resources Institute (WRI) have also been immensely useful. That being said, for this topic, many of the useful/extensive datasets exist behind a paywall. Thus, I have compiled a list of sources and reports I will be using to either re-design some charts or pull data from in order to create this presentation.

### Method and Medium
I will be completing the project through the use of Shorthand and Flourish.

I plan on writing out a script of sorts first for the website and then seeing where I can use visualizations to bolster my points. After I have an idea of the visualizations I plan to use and wireframe the project, I will conduct user research on at least 2-3 people to get feedback and find areas for improvement. Next, I will prototype my sketches and request feedback again. Once I feel confident about them, I will move on to building out the presentation on Shorthand.

I also intend on creating a seperate Shorthand page for the final presentation that just includes my main talking points for the two minute presentation.
