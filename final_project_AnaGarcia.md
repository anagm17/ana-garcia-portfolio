# Fast Fashion: Cheap to Purchase, But at What Cost?

## Part I
My goal for this project is to convince my audience (American consumers) the damage fast fashion does to the environment and show them more sustainable alternatives for clothing shopping.

### Outline
#### Set-up
Personal story: Have you ever bought a shirt or pair of jeans that fell apart after the first wash? It was most likely a fast-fashion garment. 
- What is fast fashion? Definition.
- But first: a (very) brief history of clothing industry—catalogues, standardization of sizes, rise of fast fashion, 12-16 fashion cycles a year instead of 2 (include timeline)

Fashion is a a $1.3 trillion industry (Ellen MacArthur Foundation)

#### Conflict: Industry impact to environment

- Average number of time a garment is worn has dropped 38% from 15 years ago (Ellen MacArthur Foundation)
- How long does the average fast-fashion t-shirt last? < 10 wearings (NYTimes)


Clothes making is very resource intensive
- Fashion industry is 2nd highest user of water worldwide and produces 20% of global water waste (UNECE)
- It takes 2,700 liters (713 gallons) to make one cotton shirt (WRI)
- With all that being said, clothing production is rapidly on the rise

#### Resolution: Not all hope is lost + Call to action
- Climate policy initiatives: ex) Green New Deal, UK Climate Plan 
- What can consumers do? Donate, repurpose clothes, and stop supporting fast-fashion and instead switch to sustainable alternatives (examples: Thrifting, Everlane, Frank + Oak, Patagonia, For Days, etc.)
 

### Data
This is a topic that has interested me for some time and that I have done passive research on for several years, whether that was watching videos or reading articles. [This report](https://www.ellenmacarthurfoundation.org/assets/downloads/publications/A-New-Textiles-Economy_Full-Report_Updated_1-12-17.pdf) written by the Ellen MacArthur Foundation informed the bulk of my project as well as helped me find addition resources and data to incorporate. McKinsey & Company, the World Resources Institute (WRI) have also been immensely useful. That being said, for this topic, many of the useful/extensive datasets exist behind a paywall. Thus, I have compiled a list of sources and reports I will be using to either re-design some charts or pull data from in order to create this presentation.

### Method and Medium
I will be completing the project through the use of Shorthand and Flourish.

I plan on writing out a script of sorts first for the website and then seeing where I can use visualizations to bolster my points. After I have an idea of the visualizations I plan to use and wireframe the project, I will conduct user research on at least 2-3 people to get feedback and find areas for improvement. Next, I will prototype my sketches and request feedback again. Once I feel confident about them, I will move on to building out the presentation on Shorthand.

I also intend on creating a seperate Shorthand page for the final presentation that just includes my main talking points for the two minute presentation. 

## Part II: Wireframe/Storyboard & User Research 
For this section of the project, I built my wireframe and storyboard directly into [Shorthand](https://preview.shorthand.com/Mw6V94oX9wa2qxFI). I used a combination of Flourish, Infogram, and Balsamiq (for placeholders).

### User Research Method
I used the following [Google Form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSerrMtXQyCIarJnWUZgv0L4exwRLqsSSR3rcLoKAEEnbPqL-Q/viewform?usp=sf_link) to collect user responses from 4 individuals. Participants were selected to be a mix of those who possess varying levels of knowledge with fast fashion. 

My target audience is consumers, both those that knowingly purchase/enjoy fast fashion and those that may not realize they are shopping fast fashion. Hopefully the presentation will persuade consumers to stop supporting fast fashion brands and equip them with the better, more sustainable alternatives.

#### Goals for user research:
- Whether the overall message and story is clear 
- Whether the call to action is compelling
- What works, what doesn't, and if there's any more information/data I can include to bolster the story

    <td>The graphs added a well needed shock factor which underlined the importance of the topic. The only complaint I have is with the somewhat blurry visual of the history of the clothing industry.</td>
    <td>Yes, by well sourced data.</td>

    <td>How am I contributing to this problem?</td>
    <td>I will include a blurb about each sustainable brand with more details. In the conflict section, I will name-call the big-name fast fashion brands and see if I can find data to support a ranking of which ones cause more harm, or at least some more specifics. I will also look for more data about how consumers specifically are contributing to the problem. This may also help in making the target audience more clear. I may also include more advocacy/free options for people to take action as well.</td>

    <td>Any additional comments or thoughts?</td>
    <td>It would be cool to visualize that the average fast-fashion shirt lasts less than 10 wearings, like if you could animate a shirt falling apart. I also wonder if you could add more accessible shopping options at the end. I know Patagonia and Everlane are on the higher end of price ranges.</td>
    <td>Very good so far.</td>
    <td>n/a</td>
    <td>I will order the sustainable options by price range and try to find more affordable options as well. The animation idea was cool too, I will have to see how I can make that idea come to life.</td>

#### Findings
Overall, the user research illuminated more areas where I can strengtten the story whether it be by providing more in-depth information or including additional data. I believe in adding this it will also help clarify who the target audience is. Otherwise, the visualizations I have now are strong with the exception of the first chart and its missing key.
