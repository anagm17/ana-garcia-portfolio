# Final Project

### Fast Fashion: Cheap to Purchase, But at What Cost?
My goal for this project is to convince my audience the damage fast fashion does to the environment and show them more sustainable alternatives for clothing shopping.

### Outline
#### Set-up
Personal story: Have you ever bought a shirt or pair of jeans that fell apart after the first wash? It was most likely a fast-fashion garment. 
- What is fast fashion? Definition.
- But first: a (very) brief history of clothing industryâ€”catalogues, standardization of sizes, rise of fast fashion
- How big is the fashion industry?


#### Conflict: Industry impact to environment
- Average number of time a garment is worn has dropped 38% from 15 years ago (Ellen MacArthur Foundation)
- Clothing lifecycle
- Clothes making is very resource intensive
- Fashion industry is 2nd highest user of water worldwide (UNECE)


#### Resolution: Not all hope is lost
- Policy initiatives: ex) Green New Deal, UK Climate Plan 
- What can consumers do? Donate, repurpose clothes

#### Call to action 
To stop supporting fast-fasion and instead switch to sustainable alternatives (examples: Thrifting, Everlane, Frank + Oak, Patagonia, For Days, etc.)
 


### Data
A couple paragraphs on how data will be used and link sources

### Method and Medium
