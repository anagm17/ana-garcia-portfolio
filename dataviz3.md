### Selection and Redesign Process
   I selected this chart because it is relevant to the arts and culture sector today, specifically in New York City. SMU Data Arts is a well respected national source of important data regarding the arts. Back in April SMU Data Arts partnered with the New York City Department of Cultural Affairs (DCLA) and Americans for the Arts (AFTA) to implement a survey for arts nonprofits in the city to collect data on the effect of COVID-19. This report shares the findings from the survey. In my opinion, every single chart in this report could benefit from a redesign but for the purposes of this project, I selected Figure 6. I selected it by considering the pros and cons of the chart and what I could do to improve it. My overall thoughts are that there is too much going on in the original chart that can be simplified and streamlined while still providing lots of information. 
   
   Before sketching I wrote down some things such as the goal of the chart and other keywords to help me decide whether or not I would try another chart or just clean up the existing one. The labels on the x-axis are redundant and I felt as though including the percentages within the bars was overkill, but spent a long time mulling over how I could make those clear without having so many numbers. I know the audience for this report would want specific numbers so I didn't want to oversimplify and remove those. I also spent a long time trying to figure out how I could incorporate the average amount spent in a better way than was currently on the chart. I thought about doing a bar graph with two y-axis but it wouldn't have made sense with the average numbers since the smallest percentages have the highest average amount spent. 

I wireframed my first solution with some labels for the x- and y-axis and a more descriptive title. I explained to my colleague what the report was about and then asked him if he could explain to me what was on the chart. He has no background in arts and culture so I thought it could be good to start with him as the first candidate for feedback as it could prove as a good brainstorming session since I was unsure whether the bar chart would be enough. He spent probably 60 seconds asking questions and going throught it. Some questions that came up were "expenses as a percentage of what?" and "what do the ranges on the y-axis mean?" These questions helped me clear up my labels so that they were slightly more specific. Then, he asked "why does it have to be a bar chart?" This sent us into considering some other potential charts. 

We quickly brainstormed as I sketched a stacked bar chart which showed the percentage of unanticipated expenses as a proportion of annual expenses. I also sketched out a bubble chart with increasing bubble sizes as the budget groups increaed, plotted against percentage of annual expenses and average amount spent. Then I fleshed those out and got more feedback from the same colleague who felt the stacked bar chart would be a better option. 

I decided to prototype it on Flourish to see how it would look, and the stacked bar char ended up feeling a bit redundant. The bubble chart also felt too complex for such few data points. I ended up running the bar chart by another colleague again for more input. She is also an Arts Management student and someone I would consider more knowledgeable with this kind of data. She was confused by the "Overall" category that is shown in the original bar chart, so I decided to remove it altogether because I found that it did not add very much to the overall visualization. 

# Redesigned Chart

I ended up going with a redesign that simplified the existing one with a stronger title that emphasized the supporting paragraph and overall conclusions gleaned from the data. The tick marks for every 2 percentage points allows the reader to clearly see the exact percentage without having to re-write it. Since Flourish doesn't allow adding additional text to the right of each bar, I included the average amount spent as a pop-up, but for the actual report I would have added the $ amount without being in parenthesis. Overall I find this redesign is much more sleak while still presenting the same amount of detailed information.
